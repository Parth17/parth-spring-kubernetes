# Getting Started

### Parth-Spring-Kubernetes

I have developed two demo services using springboot with deployment in Kubernetes on local using minikube


Services :

1. demo-backend: API call that returns the current Hello ‘Name’.
‘Name’ should be set from an environment variable. E.g. if $NAME = Parth
so it should print "Hello Parth”



2. demo-frontend: Calls backend and prints the string returned from backend and
appends the date and time. E.g. It should print "01/01/2020 12:00 Hello
Parth", when curl from the frontend service’s pod or if open in the
browser.
